Perceptron and Neural Network Implementations

This repository contains Python implementations of Perceptrons and Neural Networks for solving basic logical functions like AND, OR, and XOR.

Perceptrons:

Implemented a Perceptron class capable of learning and predicting logical functions with adjustable learning rate and number of epochs.
Demonstrated the usage of Perceptrons to solve logical AND and OR functions, showcasing their simplicity and effectiveness for linearly separable problems.
Multilayer Perceptron (Neural Network):

Developed a multilayer Perceptron (neural network) capable of learning non-linear relationships.
Trained the neural network on the XOR function, showing its ability to learn and predict non-linear patterns.
Contents:

perceptron.py: Contains the implementation of the Perceptron class and logical functions like AND, OR, and XOR.
it also Includes the implementation of a simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer trained to solve the XOR problem.
Usage:

Clone the repository and run the Python scripts to see Perceptrons and Neural Networks in action.
Experiment with different parameters such as learning rate, number of epochs, and hidden layer size to observe their effects on learning and prediction accuracy.
Feel free to explore, modify, and extend the implementations for your own projects or educational purposes!
